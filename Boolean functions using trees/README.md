# Boolean functions using trees

This code creates a tree for any Boolean funtion you enter. The inputs added (by changing the main) by the user are the combinations that give a "True" output (1). 
The code then creates a tree to wich these inputs lead to 1.
The user can then add any combination and check if it gives 1 or 0 as an output by changing the main.
This code relies on the fact that the user is going to input combinations of the same size.
